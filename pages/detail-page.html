                <p2>Convergence is one of the paintings by American artist Jackson Pollock, who is known as a representative of abstract expressionism. The composition was created on a canvas, measuring 93.5 inches by 155 inches. It is an oil painting, which constitutes wide range of colors, lines and shapes, made by method of dripping and pouring paint onto canvas. These lines, spots, circles splattered on a canvas unintentionally convey the artist's emotions. The painting was made during the Cold War with Russia, and it is considered that the painting represents the idea of freedom of speech.</p2>
